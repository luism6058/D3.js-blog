  <h1>Entry 2: Knowing Your way around D3.</h1>
  <h2>D3 can be an image circle map!</h2>
  <p>An image circle maps, from the examples I have seen throughout my explorations, 
  that at first start off as a large circle, then as you move your mouse over the circle
  it becomes msaller and spreads into more circles making an image appear over time.
  While it may seem really simple, the code behind it is very complex and difficult to under stand.
  However, this wont stop me from attempting my own version of an image circle map. As that will most likely
  be what i create at the end of my exploration. You can click <a href="https://bl.ocks.org/nswamy14/df13d67b6efeb19eb640">here</a> 
  for the link of the image circle map that inspired me!</p>
  <h2>D3 can help show who voted for which party!</h2>
  <p>D3.js is used when working with Data, which is clearly used when showing 
  voting trends with elections. using D3 helps beautify the front-end of an application
  since D3 is a front end language of coding after all. Using d3 helps give color and order to select tags that need them. sometimes specific
  tags, sometimeso ther but with d3, there can be very different ways of representing trends today
  and what are the causes and how they affect others and also clearly showing how trends are throughout the years
  that they are presemt.</p>
  <h2>Take aways </h2>
  <li>At first i thought d3 was another way of using tags in css but after looking through examples, 
  I know that they're way more </li>
  <li>D3 is used in very practical projects</li>
  <li>D3 is a front end language, which means i most likely wont have to work more on the back end</li>
