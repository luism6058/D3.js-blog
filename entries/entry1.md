 # Entry 1:
## Introduction:
Welcome to my blog this will be my final project for the software engineering program.
This is the final year and after working on ruby for most of the semester and mastering 
the basics of app making and how to deploy our apps successfully. Now we're going to be showing off
our knowledge and expertise in coding by doing our own independent study on a topic
of our own choosing and studying it for 9 weeks and at the ned showing off our product, 
which will likely be a website that uses d3.js and show where and how it is used.
## What is D3.js?
D3.js stands for Data Driven Document, hence D3. It is also part of the Javascript Library 
and allows for a simpler use of CSS in the html file, for example: ```j d3.selectAll("p").style("color","white)```
is a simplified version of how to change the color of the p tag. Normally that would have been a 3-4 line piece
of code but by using d3.js it is now simply a one line piece of code.
### How to install d3.js onto the desktop
   To install the latest version <a href="https://d3js.org/">Click here</a>
   as that is the only link I have found so far that has the latest update of
   d3.js. After searching through websites and constantly checking the markdown cheatsheet to remember how to use markdown
   I realized that there must also be a cheatsheet for the same purpose as mark down which I did find which is right  
   <a href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#images">here.</a> To fully see what d3.js can do,
   here is an image that uses hexagon shapes, often seen using d3.js

    ![missingImage2.jpg](images/21datadriven590.jpg "Logo Title Text 1")<img src=""></img>
   <br>
   After going through several examples on Github I can see that it is clear that d3.js 
   is mainly used for CSS and can be used as shorthand for longer CSS uses in the html file
   Some other uses for the d3.js API are also the following:
   
   <li>Selections</li>
<li>Transitions</li>
 <li>Arrays</li>
<li>Math</li>
 <li>Color</li>
 <li>Scales</li>
 <li>SVG</li>
 <li>Time</li>
<li> Layouts</li>
<li> Geography</li>
 <li>Geometry</li>
<li> Behaviors</li>
<h1>Takeaways</h1>
<li>The uses of d3.js are very wide making my option very large</li>
<li>For D3.js there are plenty of sources, making it easy to explore different ideas to use d3.js</li>
<li>After searching for days on what to do, I have decided but I know if it doesn't lead up to what I was
expecting then i could switch and quickly get back on track with the new project.</li>
 
   ```
   <h1> Hello world</h1>
   ```
