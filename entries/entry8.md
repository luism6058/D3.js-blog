# The Penultimate Entry

This is the second to last entry for my independent study project, so there probably won't be much to tell other than a change of heart
of mine on my project. Throughout my past entries I have constantly been working on my image circle porjects, with help from Mr.Mueller
and asking for some help outside of class, but to no avail, I still could not get the image to upload to the image to the front end, let
alone get it to upload as a circle. Furthermore the code was still somewhat complexing even through searching through stackoverflow and 
other d3 tutorial websites, I could barely find any example of the code that was used in the image circle map, which is why I spent half
the time writing this entry, working on a new project that still involves circles but with a different objective. If you wish to see it then

## Takeaways
 The only takeaway I really have at this point is to always have backup ideas. Just in case a project does not pan out it would be good
 to work on other projects in your free time, or when you feel like procrastinating to keep you busy and ontop of your work load. I know
 if I had worked on another project while figuring out the circle image I would have probably switched sooner and continued working on my side 
 project since the Image circle clearly did not pan out as far as I would have liked it to.
