# The Penultimate Entry

This is the second to last entry for my independent study project, so there probably won't be much to tell other than a change of heart
of mine on my project. Throughout my past entries I have constantly been working on my image circle porjects, with help from Mr.Mueller
and asking for some help outside of class, but to no avail, I still could not get the image to upload to the image to the front end, let
alone get it to upload as a circle. Furthermore the code was still somewhat complexing even through searching through stackoverflow and 
other d3 tutorial websites, I could barely find any example of the code that was used in the image circle map, which is why I spent half
the time writing this entry, working on a new project that still involves circles but with a different objective. If you wish to see it then
