# Entry 7 
In week 7 of the final project steps of our independent studies are coming to a close and I have gotten my
project to work, partly, on the C9 workspace, thanks to some help from my teacher, Mr.Mueller who helped 
me assess the situation and check the Javascript console and found out that the only reason the examples 
would not work would be because the scripts were ont used securely, so we simply added the s  at the end of http
and the example would work which can be found if you click [here](examples.html)
