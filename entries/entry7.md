# Entry 7 
In week 7 of the final project steps of our independent studies are coming to a close and I have gotten my
project to work, partly, on the C9 workspace, thanks to some help from my teacher, Mr.Mueller who helped 
me assess the situation and check the Javascript console and found out that the only reason the examples 
would not work would be because the scripts were ont used securely, so we simply added the s  at the end of http
and the example would work which can be found if you search in the entries file in the examples html file.

## Final fix-ups
 While I know have pasted all of my project onto an html file, I am still unsure how to make the images appear in circles,
 once I achieve that I can start changing the shapes the images render as, while also hoping to add a
 selection of other shapes, only after I get the image to render as a circle. However, if I cannot finish it in time I will
 work on it afterwards and use one of the examples, of course edited, to present after week 9.
 
 ## Takeaways
 
 While my project took so long because of minor errors and confusion between the warnings and errors I 
 recieved, I would have saved myself weeks of work time if I had just asked for help, either from my 
 teacher Mr.Mueller, or a fellow classamte and fully used all of the resources available to us. Which 
 is why my takeaway this week is to always ask for help, when I checked the blog list for tips, most I saw
 were for Ear Sketch or CSS SASS, with some others including myself doing projects that a lot of people
 chose not to do, which really discouraged me in the beginning up until last week when I asked for help
 from Mr.Mueller and we quickly resolved the biggest issue on why I did not use c9 to work on my projects
 so if you ever feel lost in your project and you're not sure if anyone will get it, just ask, because you never
 know if someone might have the same question or have the answer and save you plenty of time and trouble for your
 project.
